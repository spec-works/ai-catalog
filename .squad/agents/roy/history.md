## Learnings

Team formed 2026-04-02. Initial setup — no code yet.

### 2026-04-02: Architecture and Domain Model Ready for Implementation

**Deckard's ADRs produced:** ADR-002 (domain model: 9 public types), ADR-004 (parsing & serialization strategy with System.Text.Json).

**Tyrell's spec extraction:** 80+ requirements, ADR-002 domain model validated against CDDL schema.

**Next phase:** Phase 1 (core models) ready. Roy (.NET) and Pris (Python) implement domain models (no parsing/serialization yet). Leon then writes test fixtures. Phase 3 (parsing/serialization) requires both.
